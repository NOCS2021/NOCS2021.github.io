                                <p>Increasing deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in a myriad of applications,
                                    has recently fueled interest in the development of specific accelerator architectures
                                    capable of meeting their stringent performance and energy consumption requirements.</p>
                                <p>DNN accelerators use three separate NoCs within the accelerator, namely distribution,
                                    multiplier and reduction networks (or DN, MN and RN, respectively) between the global
                                    buffer(s) and compute units (multipliers/adders). These NoCs enable data delivery,
                                    and more importantly, on-chip reuse of operands and outputs to minimize the expensive
                                    off-chip memory accesses.</p>
                                <p>Among them, the RN, used to generate and reduce the partial sums produced during DNN
                                    processing, is what implies the largest fraction of chip area (25% of the total chip
                                    area in some cases) and power dissipation (38% of the total chip power budget), thus
                                    representing a first-order driver of the energy efficiency of the accelerator.</p>
                                <p>RNs can be orchestrated to exploit a Temporal, Spatial or Spatio-Temporal reduction
                                    dataflow. Among these, the latter is the one that has shown superior performance.
                                    However, as we demonstrate in this work, a state-of-the-art implementation of the
                                    Spatio-Temporal reduction dataflow, based on the addition of Accumulators (Ac) to
                                    the RN (i.e. RN+Ac strategy), can result into significant area and energy expenses.
                                    To cope with this important issue, we propose STIFT (that stands for <em>Spatio-Temporal Integrated Folding Tree</em>) that implements the Spatio-Temporal reduction dataflow entirely on the RN hardware
                                    substrate (i.e. without the need of the extra accumulators). STIFT results into significant
                                    area and power savings regarding the more complex RN+Ac strategy, at the same time
                                    its performance advantage is preserved.</p>

                                <p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) algorithms are expected to be core components of next-generation
                                    applications. These high performance sensing and recognition algorithms are key enabling
                                    technologies of smarter systems that make appropriate decisions about their environment.
                                    The integration of these compute-intensive and memory-hungry algorithms into embedded
                                    systems will require the use of specific energy-efficient hardware accelerators. The
                                    intrinsic parallelism of DNNs algorithms allows for the use of a large number of small
                                    processing elements, and the tight exploitation of data reuse can significantly reduce
                                    power consumption. To meet these features, many dataflow models and on-chip communication
                                    proposals have been studied in recent years. This paper proposes a comprehensive study
                                    of on-chip communication properties based on the analysis of application-specific
                                    features, such as data reuse and communication models, as well as the results of mapping
                                    these applications to architectures of different sizes. In addition, the influence
                                    of mechanisms such as broadcast and multicast on performance and energy efficiency
                                    is analyzed. This study leads to the definition of overarching features to be integrated
                                    into next-generation on-chip communication infrastructures for CNN accelerators.</p>

                                <p>Conventional AI accelerators are limited by von-Neumann bottlenecks for edge workloads.
                                    Domain-specific accelerators (often neuromorphic) solve this by applying near/in-memory
                                    computing, NoC-interconnected massive-multicore setups, and data-flow computation.
                                    This requires an effective mapping of neural networks (i.e, an assignment of network
                                    layers to cores) to balance resources/memory, computation, and NoC traffic. Here,
                                    we introduce a mapping called Snake for the predominant convolutional neural networks
                                    (CNNs). It utilizes the feed-forward nature of CNNs by folding layers to spatially
                                    adjacent cores. We achieve a total NoC bandwidth improvement of up to 3.8X for MobileNet
                                    and ResNet vs. random mappings. Furthermore, NEWROMAP is proposed that continues to
                                    optimize Snake mapping through a meta-heuristic; it also simulates the NoC traffic
                                    and can work with TensorFlow models. The communication is further optimized with up
                                    to 22.52% latency improvement vs. pure snake mapping shown in simulations.</p>

                                    data intensive parallel systems. Due to tight time-to-market constraints, manufacturers
                                    are exploring the possibility of integrating several third-party Intellectual Property
                                    (IP) cores in their TCMP designs. Presence of malicious Hardware Trojan (HT) in the
                                    NoC routers can adversely affect communication between tiles leading to degradation
                                    of overall system performance. In this paper, we model an HT mounted on the input
                                    buffers of NoC routers that can alter the destination address field of selected NoC
                                    packets. We study the impact of such HTs and analyse its first and second order impacts
                                    at the core level, cache level, and NoC level both quantitatively and qualitatively.
                                    Our experimental study shows that the proposed HT can bring application to a complete
                                    halt by stalling instruction issue and can significantly impact the miss penalty of
                                    L1 caches. The impact of re-transmission techniques in the context of HT impacted
                                    packets getting discarded is also studied. We also expose the unrealistic assumptions
                                    and unacceptable latency overheads of existing mitigation techniques for packet header
                                    attacks and emphasise the need for alternative cost effective HT management techniques
                                    for the same.</p>

                                <p>Network-on-Chip (NoC) is widely used as an efficient communication architecture in
                                    multi-core and many-core System-on-Chips (SoCs). However, the shared communication
                                    resources in NoCs, e.g., channels, buffers, and routers might be used to conduct attacks
                                    compromising the security of NoC-based SoCs. Almost all of the proposed encryption-based
                                    protection methods in the literature need to leave some parts of the packet unencrypted
                                    to allow the routers to process/forward packets accordingly. This uncovers the source/destination
                                    information of the packet to malicious routers, which can be used in various attacks.
                                    In this paper, we propose the idea of secure anonymous routing with minimal hardware
                                    overhead to hide the source/destination information while exchanging secure information
                                    over the network. The proposed method uses a novel source-routing algorithm that works
                                    with encrypted destination addresses and prevents malicious routers from discovering
                                    the source/destination of secure packets. To support our proposal, we have designed
                                    and implemented a new NoC architecture that works with encrypted addresses. The conducted
                                    hardware evaluations show that the proposed security solution combats the security
                                    threats at an affordable cost of 1% area and 10% power overheads chip-wide.</p>

                                <p>State-of-the-art System-on-Chip (SoC) designs consist of many Intellectual Property
                                    (IP) cores that interact using a Network-on-Chip (NoC) architecture. SoC designers
                                    increasingly rely on global supply chains for obtaining third-party IPs. In addition
                                    to inherent vulnerabilities associated with utilizing third-party IPs, NoC based SoCs
                                    enable attackers to exploit the distributed nature of NoC and its connectivity with
                                    various IPs to launch a plethora of attacks. Specifically, Denial-of-Service (DoS)
                                    attacks pose a serious threat in degrading the SoC performance by flooding the NoC
                                    with unnecessary packets. In this paper, we present a machine learning-based runtime

                                    used for runtime attack detection leading to minimum runtime performance overhead.
                                    Our approach is capable of detecting DoS attacks with high accuracy, even in the presence
                                    of unpredictable NoC traffic patterns caused by various application mappings. We extensively

                                <p>The integration of many processing elements per die makes it more difficult to provide
                                    low latency in the Network-on-Chip (NoC). Multihop bypass proposals, such as SMART,
                                    attack this problem by allowing flits to skip multiple routers in the path in a single
                                    cycle, drastically reducing latency while preserving a regular tiled layout. However,
                                    multihop bypass routers are more complex and relatively different from traditional
                                    NoC routers, since they rely on global broadcast signals and global allocation mechanisms.
                                    Additionally, the maximum number of nodes that can be bypassed within a single cycle
                                    is limited by the Critical Path Delay (CPD) of the NoC. Hence, a practical multihop
                                    bypass mechanism must also minimize this delay.</p>
                                <p>To simplify the design of multihop bypass mechanisms, this work introduces PlugSMART,
                                    an open-source pluggable Verilog module that extends a traditional router to support
                                    multihop bypass. PlugSMART follows a black box approach, requiring minimal modifications
                                    from the original router. As an application of PlugSMART, we introduce ProSMART, a
                                    multihop bypass extension of the efficient NoC router ProNoC. ProSMART is evaluated
                                    using simulations, FPGA, and ASIC synthesis. Results show that it is more performant
                                    and requires significantly fewer resources than previous open-source designs. The
                                    comparison with OpenSMART++, the most recent state-of-the-art SMART-based NoC, shows
                                    up to a 50% reduction in both area and CPD. Overall, PlugSMART constitutes a simple
                                    alternative for fast and efficient upgrading of existing NoC routers, allowing to
                                    implement multihop bypass and significantly improve performance while preserving the
                                    original characteristics of the router design.</p>

                                <p>The recent line of Versal FPGA devices from Xilinx Inc. includes a hard Network-On-Chip
                                    (NoC) embedded in the programmable logic, designed to be a high-performance system-level
                                    interconnect. While the target markets for Versal devices include applications with
                                    real-time constraints, such as automotive driver assist, the associated development
                                    tools only provide figures for "structural latencies" of data packets, which assume
                                    that the network is otherwise idle. In a realistic setting, this information is not
                                    enough to ensure deadlines are met, as different packets can contend for NoC switch
                                    outputs, which causes packet contents to be buffered while in transit, increasing
                                    their latency. In this work, we present a formal description of the NPS switches that

                                    available cycle-accurate switch simulation code. We then analyze a scenario where
                                    network clients transfer data periodically over a single switch, and propose a method
                                    for calculating worst-case communication times in this scenario.</p>

                                <p>Synchoros VLSI design style has been proposed as an alternative to the standard cell-based
                                    design style; the word synchoros is derived from the Greek word choros for space.
                                    Synchoricity discretises space with a virtual grid, the way synchronicity discretises
                                    time with clock ticks. SiLago (Silicon Lego) blocks are atomic synchoros building
                                    blocks like Lego bricks. SiLago blocks absorb all metal layer details, i.e., all wires,

                                    synchoricity does need a finite number of SiLago block types to cater to different
                                    types of designs. Global NoCs are important system level design components. In this
                                    paper, we show, how with a small library of SiLago blocks for global NoCs, it is possible
                                    to automatically synthesize arbitrary global NoCs of different types, dimensions,
                                    and topology. The synthesized global NoCs are not only valid VLSI designs, but their
                                    cost metrics (area, latency, and energy) are known with post-layout accuracy in linear
                                    time. We argue that this is essential to be able to do chip-level design space exploration.
                                    We show how the abstract timing model of such global NoC SiLago blocks can be built
                                    and used to analyse the timing of global NoC links with post layout accuracy and in
                                    linear time. We validate this claim by subjecting the same VLSI designs of global
                                    NoC to commercial EDA's static timing analysis and show that the abstract timing analysis
                                    enabled by synchoros VLSI design gives the same results as the commercial EDA tools.</p>

                                <p>SoC security has become essential with devices now pervasive in critical infrastructure
                                    in homes and businesses. Today's embedded SoCs are becoming increasingly high-performance
                                    and complex, comprising multiple cores, accelerators, and IP blocks interconnected
                                    with a Network-on-Chip (NoC). As these IPs can originate from diverse sources, they
                                    cannot be trusted to form the root of trust in SoCs. However, the NoC itself, being
                                    the communication backbone linking all IPs, is naturally positioned to be the basis
                                    for a secure SoC. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient solution that both meets
                                    the stringent requirements of modern embedded SoC designs, while maintaining a high
                                    level of security.</p>
                                <p>In this paper, we demonstrate how statically-scheduled NoCs inherently enforce traffic
                                    isolation and non-interference of communication. The time-division multiplexing (TDM)
                                    of NoC links across applications <em>provably</em> ensures that security properties are fulfilled. However, conventional TDM NoCs are
                                    still vulnerable to side-channel attacks. We thus propose temporal and data obfuscation
                                    schemes that can be embedded within static TDM NoCs, randomizing source-destination
                                    communication patterns and switching activity over the links. Our proposed statically-scheduled
                                    <em>Sentry-NoC</em> links up untrusted IP blocks to form a secure SoC. <em>Sentry-NoC</em> targets key security properties to effectively mitigate side-channel attacks with
                                    an extremely low overhead, reducing average temporal correlation by 81% and average
                                    data correlation by 91%.</p>

                                <p>Network-on-Chip (NoC) Firewall provides memory protection and process isolation. In
                                    this paper, we design, implement and validate hierarchical Linux security primitives
                                    on top of a custom NoC Firewall module embedded on the ARM-based Xilinx Zedboard FPGA.
                                    Our open-source, multi-layer security protocols aim to protect the privacy of application
                                    keys stored in non-cacheable BRAM. Experimental results derived from integrating security
                                    within a soft real-time electrocardiogram monitoring, analysis, and visualization
                                    application allow evaluating the software overhead of the proposed security primitives.
                                    Preliminary results indicate that the performance overhead for supporting data privacy
                                    is acceptable for one-time authentication schemes. However, relative to the processing
                                    requirements of the E-Health application, security overheads are large, and cannot
                                    sustain continuous authentication schemes.</p>
