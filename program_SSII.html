                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
                    High performance and extreme energy efficiency are growing requirements for wide class of
                    applications ranging from ultra-low power IoT end nodes to high performance computing. While
                    parallelism and heterogeneity are well established techniques to deal with these challenges in the
                    high-performance domain, an increasing amount of embedded systems are embracing the same approach
                    to deal with the increasing complexity of near-sensor analytics applications. However increasing the
                    number and capabilities of compute cores poses a high-pressure on the on-chip communication network,
                    which has to sustain the extreme bandwidth generated by multiple powerful engines. In this special
                    session we propose an open source ecosystem for building computing systems from edge to cloud. The
                    sessions starts with a presentation of the Parallel Ultra-Low-Power project, an open-source platform
                    for near-sensor processing, followed by the presentation of an open-source AXI4 infrastructure and
                    its exploitation heterogeneous application processors and HPC many-core system.

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
                    The "internet of everything" envisions trillions of connected objects loaded with high-bandwidth
                    sensors requiring massive amounts of local signal processing, fusion, pattern extraction and
                    classification. While silicon access cost is naturally decreasing due to the twilight of the
                    Moore's law, the access to hardware IPs still represents a huge barrier for innovative start-ups
                    and companies approaching the market of IoT. In this context, the recent growth of high-quality
                    open source hardware IPs represents a promising way to surpass this barrier, paving the way for a
                    number of exciting applications of open-source electronics. In this talk, I will describe the
                    evolution of the open-source Parallel-Ultra-Low-Power (PULP) platform as well as opportunities and
                    challenges for next generation open source computing systems.

                    <strong>Date:</strong> Friday - October 15, 2021<br>
                    <strong>Time:</strong> 12:00 - 12:20<br>
                    <strong>Title:</strong> An Open-Source Platform for High-Performance Non-Coherent On-Chip
                    Communication<br>
                    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Thomas Benz (ETH Z&uuml;rich)<br>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
                    Modern SoCs rely on a scalable and efficient on-chip communication infrastructure. With a steady
                    increase of the core count, heterogeneity of the components, and the on-chip and off-chip bandwidth,
                    on-chip communication gains importance. Despite the key importance of on-chip communication
                    infrastructure, almost all communication standards are closed or cannot be used royalty-free. ARM's
                    Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) is one exception to this rule. But even with the AXI standard
                    being open, most implementations are propriety and closed-source rendering them of little benefit
                    for our open-source research. At IIS, we are working towards a modular, energy-efficient,
                    topology-agnostic, high-performance, free and open-source implementation of ARM's AXI4 on-chip
                    protocol. The resulting IPs are used in all our research platforms from simple microcontroller to a
                    1024-core ML training accelerator. We evaluate our modules standalone and in our research platforms
                    to verify their functionality and explore key microarchitectural trade-offs between area,
                    throughput, latency, and energy-efficiency.

                    <strong>Title:</strong> HERO: A Heterogenous Research Platform to Explore HW/SW Codesign and RISC-V
                    manycore accelerators<br>
                    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Luca Bertaccini (ETH Z&uuml;rich)<br>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
                    Heterogeneous systems on chip integrate a general-purpose multicore CPU with programmable manycore
                    accelerators on a single die to combine the versatility of host application-class processors with
                    the energy efficiency of highly parallel domain-specific accelerators. In this talk, we present
                    HERO, a heterogeneous research platform prototyped on a Xilinx Zynq UltraScale+ FPGA and coupling an
                    ARM Linux-capable host CPU with a PULP acceleration cluster. HERO’s software stack allows for
                    transparent accelerator programming based on OpenMP. The HW/SW infrastructure of HERO results in a
                    run time overhead lower than 10% with respect to manually written code PMCA code operating on its
                    private memory.

                    Ultra-Efficient Floating-Point Computing<br>
                    <strong>Speaker:</strong> Florian Zaruba (ETH Z&uuml;rich)<br>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
                    Data-parallel problems demand ever-growing floating-point (FP) operations per second under tight
                    area- and energy-efficiency constraints. In this talk, we will present Manticore, a general-purpose,
                    ultra-efficient, chiplet-based architecture for data-parallel FP workloads. We have manufactured a
                    prototype of the chiplet’s computational core in Globalfoundries 22FDX process and demonstrate more
                    than 5x improvement in energy efficiency on FP intensive workloads compared to CPUs and GPUs,
                    despite being manufactured in a 2-3 generation older technology node. The Manticore architecture is
                    able to achieve up to 190 Gflop/sW for FP64 in maximum efficiency mode. The main focus of this talk
                    will be on how we use our non-coherent, AXI-based, infrastructure to efficiently schedule data
                    movement in those complex NoCs and the corresponding infrastructure to generate such networks.
